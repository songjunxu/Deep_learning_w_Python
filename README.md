## Deep learning wth Python (Keras & Scikit learn)
Get started, learn to build deep learning models and apply deep learning to my own projects

### Outline
1. Try out Theano.
2. Try out TensorFlow.
3. Try out Keras.
4. Develop First Neural Network in Keras.
5. Use Keras Models With Scikit-Learn.
6. Save Best Model During Training With Checkpointing in Keras
7. Reduce Overfitting With Dropout Regularization
8. Lift Performance With Learning Rate Schedules
9. Develop a single layer perceptron and deep CNN model for MNIST classification
